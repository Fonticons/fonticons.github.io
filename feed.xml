      <title>Introducing Fonticons</title>
      <description>&lt;p class=&quot;info&quot;&gt;&lt;i class=&quot;icon icon-newspaper-o initial&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt;
After several months of hard work, &lt;a href=&quot;http://twitter.com/supercodepoet&quot;&gt;Travis&lt;/a&gt; and I are crazy
excited to announce a limited release of the Fonticons beta. Interested? Head on over to
&lt;a href=&quot;https://fonticons.com/request/new&quot;&gt;request an invitation&lt;/a&gt; and we&#39;ll get you one as soon as we can.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Fonticons makes web icons fast and easy.&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With Fonticons, you&amp;#39;ll be able to choose just the right icon set to match the look and feel of your website, then get
just the icons and CSS you need &amp;mdash; making your site load even faster.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Icon Fonts&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Icon fonts are a great way to get scalable vector graphics on your website, then get complete control over them with
CSS. That&amp;#39;s why I created &lt;a href=&quot;http://fontawesome.io&quot;&gt;Font Awesome&lt;/a&gt; a couple of years ago. Font Awesome gives you a
large set of scalable vector icons for just about anything your site needs. Its CSS features that make it even
easier to use icons at larger sizes, as bullets, or to even spin, stack, and rotate icons.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://meanpath.com/f/HcZE2d&quot;&gt;According to meanpath&lt;/a&gt;, Font Awesome is now on almost 3 million websites. And we
continue to see more and more traffic every month.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Why Fonticons?&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As simple and powerful as icon fonts are to use, they aren&amp;#39;t perfect.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First, people visiting your website have to download every single icon in the set. Our research shows that most websites
only use around 20 icons total. Font Awesome, for example, has almost 500 icons. That&amp;#39;s a lot of icons going across the
wire that your site isn&amp;#39;t using. And there&amp;#39;s likely a good bit of CSS you don&amp;#39;t need either. That slows your site down.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Second, what if your icon set doesn&amp;#39;t have the exact icon you need? Or what if you want to serve up your company logo?
Creating your own icon font is no simple task. You&amp;#39;ll need to learn a typesetting tool, figure out how font metrics work,
make your icons pixel perfect, export to the right webfont formats, figure out the CSS to integrate everything, then get
your web server to serve up the custom font to every browser without cross-site failures. It&amp;#39;s a big bag of hurt.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Web icons should easier. That&amp;#39;s why we made Fonticons.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Tons of Icon Sets&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Just like Helvetica isn&amp;#39;t the perfect typographic font for every website on earth, one single icon set isn&amp;#39;t
perfect for everyone either. The right set of icons reinforces the exact look and feel you need. We believe iconography
should have the same level of variety, beauty, and refinement seen in traditional typography.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To give you the best icon sets to choose from, we&amp;#39;ve scoured the web and heavily curated just the right ones. We&amp;#39;ve made
sure each set has a large number of icons, so you&amp;#39;ll be more likely to find the perfect icon when you need it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Curious? &lt;a href=&quot;https://fonticons.com/fonts&quot;&gt;Check &amp;#39;em out &amp;raquo;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;We&amp;#39;re carefully adding new icon sets as we find just the right ones. Think we&amp;#39;re missing a set?
&lt;a href=&quot;mailto:dave@fonticons.com&quot;&gt;Let me know&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Speed up Your Website&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since Fonticons allows you to load just the icons and CSS your website uses, you&amp;#39;ll drastically speed up their load time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For example, if this blog were using stock Font Awesome 4.2.0, our icons and CSS would weigh in at 87.4kb.
Using Fonticons, this blog&amp;#39;s kit weighs in at 4.06kb. That&amp;#39;s a &lt;strong&gt;95% bandwidth savings&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Powerful, Simple CSS Toolkit&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We&amp;#39;ve paired the best icon sets with Font Awesome&amp;#39;s powerful CSS toolkit. That makes it easier to control and style your
icons exactly the way you need. You can also pare down to just the CSS your site needs, making your kit load even faster.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Served up from a CDN&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We&amp;#39;ve partnered up with &lt;a href=&quot;http://maxcdn.com&quot;&gt;MaxCDN&lt;/a&gt; to serve your icons crazy fast. Their global network means your kit
loads faster and more reliably anywhere in the world. Even our free accounts are served by MaxCDN!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;PS. We love you, MaxCDN. You&amp;#39;ve been hosting Font Awesome on BootstrapCDN since the early days. You&amp;#39;re awesome!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Custom Icons &amp;mdash; COMING SOON!&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Want to add your company logo to your kit? Or anything else you can imagine? Fonticons makes it easy to upload and
manage your own custom vector icons.&lt;/p&gt;
